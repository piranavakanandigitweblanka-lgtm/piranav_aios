## Core Rules Applied Across All Reports

- `order_management.orders.market_place = 10` — Germany DE only
- `orders.status = 'Completed'` — excludes Refunded and Cancelled
- INNER JOIN `inventory.local_inventory_current_stock_location_wise WHERE warehouse_location = 'Germany'` — strict DE warehouse rows only
- OOS = `licsl.stock = 0` | In-stock = `licsl.stock > 0`
- OOS date proxy = `MAX(order_date)` per SKU
- Lost sales = `(annual_sales / 365) × days_oos`
- PPC waste = spend on dates `> last_order_date` per SKU
